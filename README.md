# Quick Check
Quick Check is a program to run the Daily Check for you! It does it quickly (usually in under 10 seconds, depending on the speed of your internet connection.)

> By using this program, you affirm that you are submitting a true and complete Daily Check. Submitting a false Daily Check puts everyone at Cornell at risk. Don't do that. That is bad.

Install it with `npm` or `yarn`

```shell
$ npm i -g quickcheck
$ yarn global add quickcheck
```

Note that Quick Check installs an instance of Firefox, which does take up a bit of space (about 187 MB). You can look into alternate options on [this page](https://playwright.dev/#?path=docs/installation.md). Note that only Firefox is officially supported, and your mileage may vary with other browsers.
