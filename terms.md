# Quick Check Terms and Conditions

> Last updated 2020-11-11

Hi there! Thanks for using Quick Check. I'll try to keep this short and sweet. By using Quick Check, you agree to these terms.

1. Any data submitted to the Daily Check on your behalf is _your data_. You agree not to hold me, the developer of Quick Check, liable for any inaccuracies that may occur, either due to human error or programming mistakes.
2. You agree to submit an accurate Daily Check when using this program. Note that this may require reconfiguring Quick Check if any of your responses change.
3. You agree not to automate the running of Quick Check, for example, so it is run at a certain time every day. Doing so defeats the purpose of the daily check, and puts the entire Cornell community at risk. (For example, it would be a violation of these terms to use `cron` to run Quick Check).

You also agree to periodically check these terms, as they are subject to change at any time without prior warning.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me! My contact info is at my website, [willbarkoff.dev](https://willbarkoff.dev).

Thanks for using Quick Check!
